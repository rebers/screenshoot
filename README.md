- 💾 Export directly to PNG or copy to clipboard
- 🔒 100% client-side - your images never leave your browser

## The AI-powered dev story

This entire app was built in one afternoon, with the help of Cursor AI. That's right, an AI helped write most of this code. The future is now, and it's surprisingly good at CSS.

As they say in the vibe coding community: "Why spend 10 hours debugging when you can spend 10 minutes prompting?" (Nobody actually says this, but now YOU can start saying it and sound cool at developer meetups).
